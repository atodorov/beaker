                  <para>A workflow is a model to represent real work for further assessment. More abstractly, a workflow is a pattern of activity enabled by a systematic organizatio information  flows, into a work process that can be documented and learned. Workflows are designed to achieve processing intents of some sort, such as information processing.      </para>

                      <para>You can now specify Beaker jobs using an xml file that will be workflow agnostic. This allows users a more consistent, maintainable ways of storing and submitting jobs. You can now specify and save entire jobs, including many recipes and recipesets in them, in xml files and save them as regression testsuites and such.

                        All xml tags above are pretty self explanatory. One of the biggest advantages of using xml for your jobs is not having to use different workflows for different types of tests.

You can omit guestname, in which case Beaker will assign the hostname of the guest as the name of the guest. The second attribute is guestargs , which is identical to arguments that are given to virtinstall program, except for -lvm or -part argument which indicates if the guest is to be installed on blockdevice or lvm volume respectively.
