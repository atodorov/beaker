								<para>
									The search panel has two modes; simple and advanced. The simple search is the default, and the default search is of the System <application>Name</application>, using the <application>contains</application> operator. To toggle between the two search modes, press the <application>Toggle Search</application> link. 
								</para>
								<para>
									The first column <application>(Table)</application> is the attribute on which the search is being performed; The second <application>(Operation)</application> is the type of search, and the third <application>(Value)</application> is the actual value to search on. To add another search criteria (row), click the <application>Add(+)</application> link just below the <application>Table</application> column. When using more than just one search criteria, the defaul operation between the criterias is an SQL AND operation. The operators change depending on what type of attribute is being searched. 
								</para>
								<note>
									<title>Wildcards</title>
									<para>No operator provides explicit wildcards other than the is operation, which allows the * wildcard when searching an attribute which is a string. </para>
								</note>
								<para>
									The kind of data returned in the System search can be changed by adding/removing the result columns. To do this the <application>Toggle Result</application> Columns link is pressed and the columns checked/unchecked.

                            The purpose of a Job is to provide an encapsulation of Tasks. It is to provide a single point of submission of these Tasks, and a single point of reviewing the output and results of these Tasks. The Tasks within a Job may or may not be related to each other; although it would make sense to define Jobs based on the relationship of the Tasks within it. Once a Job has been submitted you can not alter its contents, or pause it. You can however cancel it (Section 5.3.3.4, “Job Results”), and alter its Recipe Set's priorities (you can only lower the priority level if you are not in the admin group). Adjusting this priority upwards will change which Recipe Set is run sooner, and vice a versa.

Try having many Recipe Sets containing few Recipes, rather than the opposite. Of course this only applies to Recipes that do not need to be run simultaneously (i.e not Multihost Jobs) </para>

                            <para>The whole purpose of Jobs is to view the output of the Job, and more to the point, Tasks that ran within the Job. To do this, you must first go to the Job search screen (Section 5.3.2, “Job Searching”). After finding the Job you want to see the results of, click on the link in the  <application>ID</application> column.You don't have to wait until the Job has completed to view the results. Of course only the results of those Tasks that have already finished running will be available. 
                            </para>
                            <para>The Job results page is divided by<application> Recipe Set</application>. To show the results of each Recipe within these Recipe Sets, click the <application>Show All Results</application>  button. You can just show the tasks that have a status of <application>Fail</application> by clicking <application>Show Failed Results</application>.
                            </para>
                            <para>While your Job is still <application>Queued</application> it's possible to change the priority. You can change the priority of individual Recipe Sets by changing the value of <application>Priority</application>, or you can change all the Job's Recipe Sets at once by clicking an option beside the text <application>Set all RecipeSet priorities</application>, which is at the top right of the page. If successful, a green success message will briefly display, otherwise a red error message will be shown.

                              The core of each Beaker test is a <application>runtest.sh</application>  shell script. It performs the testing (or delegates the work by invoking another script or executable) and reports the results. Either write the code that performs the test in the <application>runtest.sh</application> shell script or have runtest.sh execute another program that does the bulk of the work in perhaps another language. Choose a language appropriate to the job (and with which you are familiar): testing of a library could be written in C, parsing of text streams could be done in Perl, and GUI scripting in Python. Languages can be mixed and matched as appropriate within a single test - the <application>runtest.sh</application> script can call other code as necessary. Aim for correctness and readability: remember that others may have to debug this code if a test is flawed. Here is the example<application> runtest.sh</application>:

So the most basic Beaker coding requirements are that a shell script must be sourced <application>(beaker-environment.sh)</application> and the report_result API must be called (this is called in <application>beaker-run-simple-text</application>).The output was sent to <application>$OUTPUTFILE </application>(in <application>beaker-environment.sh</application>). The Beaker API provides the <application>$OUTPUTFILE</application> variable so each test can create a log file to record its activities. When run from the command line, <application>$OUTPUTFILE</application> points to a temporary file in<application> /tmp</application>. When run in a test lab environment, the logs are stored in a central location. The report_result method is always called to inform the Beaker API of the success or failure of the test.

                              A sample Makefile is copied into the local directory when beaker-create-new-test tool is invoked (or can be found a<application>t /usr/share/doc/beaker-devel-2.6/Makefile.template</application>). The Makefile sets up certain targets and defines variables necessary for test execution and reporting. It is best to use this example when writing a new test, copying and modifying it as necessary. So for example, in order to have an executable compiled by the Makefile, the following two lines were changed. 
                              </para>

                              When <application>make run</application> is typed, the Makefile will compile<application> do-my-test.cintodo-my-test</application>  and run runtest.sh, which will then execute <application>do-my-test</application>. You do not have to enter anything in the <application>BUILT_FILES</application>  directive if you are not compiling an executable. Also be sure to fill in the following section:

This trivial test compiles a .c file, runs the resulting code, and checks
that the output is as expected.

It is intended as a simple example of how to write a test that
compiles source code to a binary and reports a single result
using rhts-run-simple-test

It can also be used as a primitive smoketest for the compiler.</screen>
